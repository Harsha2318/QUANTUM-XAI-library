# Limitations and Known Issues of Quantum-XAI Library

## Barren Plateaus in Quantum Circuits
Quantum neural networks can suffer from barren plateaus, where gradients vanish exponentially with the number of qubits or circuit depth, making training difficult.

## Parameter Initialization Sensitivity
The choice of initial parameters can significantly affect training convergence and model performance.

## Scalability Constraints
Current quantum hardware and simulators limit the size of quantum circuits, restricting the complexity of models and datasets.

## Noise and Decoherence
Real quantum devices introduce noise and decoherence, which can degrade model accuracy and explanation reliability.

## Explanation Approximation
Some explanation methods use sampling or approximations that may not fully capture the model's decision process.

## Limited Dataset Support
The library currently supports a limited set of datasets and binary classification tasks.

## Performance Overhead
Quantum simulations and explanation computations can be computationally intensive and time-consuming.

## Future Work
- Integration with more quantum hardware backends.
- Support for multi-class classification.
- Advanced noise mitigation techniques.
- More efficient and scalable explanation algorithms.
